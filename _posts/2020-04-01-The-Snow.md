## The Snow
This is a shot of my neighbors house when we had the snowfall a couple of months back.  I felt like this was a great combination of serene, beautiful, and eerie all at once.  It was so quiet outside when I took the picture.  In addition to their not being much activity on the road, the snow seems to dampen sounds to me.  This makes for a very quiet and calming atmosphere.
