## This is My Son
This picture was taken shortly after getting my camera.  I was taking some shots while our house was in disarray preparing for Christmas.  My son isn't easy to corral for a photograph.  However, this time he was a bit more amenable.  I asked him to come a little closer and used my stock 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 II R lens.  The picture came out better than I thought.  I didn't use a zoom, opting instead to get closer to the subject physically.  The side lighting from the table lamp behind me put an interesting contrast on his face.  One thing I hate that I missed is cutting the top off.  However that would have necessitated me moving back more and I would have gotten too much of the television in my shot.
