## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/me.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
My name is Michael and I guess this is where I have to tell you something about myself in an interesting way.  I was born and raised in the foothills of Appalachia.  I got to wake up every morning and go to school or work with a beautiful view of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  I'm a graduate of the Masters in Library and Information Studies program at UNC Greensboro.  However, the path I've weaved to find myself here is a winding one.  Despite my first full time job being in an academic library it still took me 20 years to pursue a graduate program in the field.  Regardless of the length of time it took me to get to this point, I'm very happy to finally be here.  

I love books, but what would be librarian doesn't?  I read voraciously, and it can be any genre, even the back of a cereal box!  I also love technology.  I can find myself getting lost in the latest updates to hardware, software, cars, and anything with a cpu.  I enjoy flinging myself at the newest gadgets and learning as much as I can about them.  It's also meant that I've pursued a lot of technical focused courses in school like Web Design & UX for librarians, HTML & CSS courses, as well as pursuing work that allows me to use those skills like as a Graduate Assistant for the UNCG Web Team where I helped campus departments and organizations with their WordPress pages.

I'm married and have two great kids.  Pictures aplenty exist of them.  More than I know what to do with at this point.  Which brings me to another thing I really love.

### I love photography

  I've always loved looking at great photographs, but lately I've finally discovered the joy in taking great photographs.  I treated myself to a mirrorless camera last year and it has been fun learning how to take photographs that involve a little more than the touch of a button.  While I wouldn't say any of my shots so far deserve to be hung on the wall of a gallery, they do bring me joy personally.  I think pictures can help us tell stories just as good as writing.

This is my mom's old house.  She lived in it until she was 15.  It's two rooms, the main living area/kitchen and the bedroom where her, her brother, and her parents all slept.  I couldn't get inside shots because it's crammed full with some of their old things and it isn't really safe to be inside it.  They didn't have electricity until she was 9, so most everything was done by candlelight.
